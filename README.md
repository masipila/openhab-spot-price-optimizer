The blue area represents the hourly spot prices of electricity. The red bars are the _control points_ for heating the domestic hot water in a boiler during the two cheapest hours of the day. The yellow bars are the _control points_ that control when the heating of a house is ON. On this example day, 14 hours of heating is distributed so that the morning and evening price peaks are avoided.
